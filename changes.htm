Changes from conceptual design to website implementation
(Please see Group64's A4 for original conceptual design we based our implementation off of)

---

Home
- Mission statement moved to about page to increase professional appeal and reduce text and clutter on opening page.
- Unable to design website logo in time for submission. Therefore, we stuck with a home button in the nav bar.
- Search bar not implemented for demo of website. Not enough content on site to properly implement search bar.
- Introductory paragraph moved under about page (see first point)

About
- Seemed informal and unnecessary to explain website's navigation and layout on the about page. The website speaks for itself.
- Only a couple of topics taught on the website are mentioned. Same reason as above for not mentioning all.
- No partners or web resources on website that need to be listed.

Lessons
- Tree structure hard to implement, since we didn't really connect the dots with the sample topics we choose.
- Figured "bubble" selectors were the best option. They are aesthetically appealing. Tree structure could be implemented in the future with the addition of more lesson topics.

Examples
- Unable to implement quiz mode due to JavaScript errors (in the works).
- Laid out example topics the same way as in Lessons, and for the same reasons.
- Links not necessary.

Forum
- Discarded the forum idea. Very hard to implement in early website building stages as it requires users to have accounts for the site.

FAQ
- N/A

Contact
- Website admin info not necessary.
